# About the project

A simple app for challenging myself 👍. This project has 2 screens. One is home screen which is showing
list of potential dating candidates. The second screen is showing list of user you have passed (or 
liked, depending on which button you tap on the 1st screen)

For the best result, I'm trying to use the same library and design pattern I'm using for production project I have built.
I've used BloC design pattern, freezed for model to support BloC's much more readable, flutter_svg 
for displaying svg files, multiscreen for dynamic mobile screen sizes 😄.

Nothing too fancy, just something you might want to take a look if you want to be a Flutter developer 😄 😄

Feel free to leave a comment. It will help me develop myself 😄 😄 😄
